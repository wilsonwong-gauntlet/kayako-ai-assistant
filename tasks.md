## 7. Conversation Orchestration & Business Logic

- [ ] **Define Conversation States**
  - [ ] `GREETING -> COLLECT_ISSUE -> KB_SEARCH -> RESPOND -> END_CALL`

- [ ] **Implement Dialog Controller**
  - [ ] If KB match is found, read snippet to user.
  - [ ] If no match, escalate and create a ticket.
  - [ ] If partial data, prompt user for email.

- [ ] **Populate Caller Details**
  - [ ] Prompt user for email if not available.
  - [ ] Store validated user details.

- [ ] **Escalation Flow**
